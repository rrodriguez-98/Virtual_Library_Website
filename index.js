Through engaging stories and scientific insights, Foer challenges the idea that a great memory is purely innate, showing instead that it's a skill that can be trained with practice and imagination.

Rovelli, a theoretical physicist, breaks down complex ideas from modern physics to show that time is far stranger than we experience it. He explains that there’s no single, universal “now”; time moves differently depending on speed and gravity; and at the quantum level, time may not even exist at all in the way we think. The book blends science with poetry and reflection, challenging our everyday assumptions and inviting us to see time not as a constant, ticking force, but as something emergent, flexible, and deeply connected to our perception and memory.",
