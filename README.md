<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

As an avid reader, I wanted to share some of my good reads in a clear and intuitive format. The book summaries were generated with Chat GPT to save time. My main focus was on generating the format and functionality of my first website. I was able to use JavaScript to expand the functionality of my website and get the individualistic user interaction that I wanted. I was challenged a bit on how to make the book summaries, favorites selection, and genre breakdown of favorites dynamic.
